Primary Key and Foreign Key

PRIMARY KEY

- A column which uniquely identifies a record in the table.
- Must be unique and cannot be null.
- Only one primary key per table.
- Primary keys are not compulsory but are highly advised!.

FOREIGN KEY

- A foreign key is used to link two tables together.
- A foreign key is a column where the values match the values of another tables primary key column.
- The table with the primary key is called the reference or parent table and the table with the foreign key is called child table.
- A table can contain Multiple Foreign Keys.


UNIQUE, NULL and CHECK CONSTRAINTS

UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS

- Ensures that column can only contain unique values.
- Throws an error if duplicate values are inserted into a column.
- We need to state whether a column should have a unique constraint while creating a table.
- Example : EmailID
